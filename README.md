# IESB Data Science Project

This work is the crystallization of the knowledge acquired in the disciplines of
“Database and Big Data Technologies” and “Applied Statistics for Science
Data”, taught during the second semester of the Data Science and Intelligence course
Artificial, with the aim of developing a complete descriptive analysis of the data
related to the Ordinary General Elections held in Brazil in 2022, to choose
of representatives in the Federal District's legislature (Governor, Senator, Deputy
Federal and District Deputy) and in the Federal Executive (for the positions of President and
Vice-President of the Republic). This work represents the different stages of creating
such analysis, from data extraction, creation and loading into a database
PostgreSQL to data analysis using Python and SAS.

**Work Organization**

*In search of greater efficiency in carrying out this work, it was
subdivided into 3 stages:*
# Creation of the Data Engineering structure
After normalizing the bases, tables were developed with restrictions on
integrity and declaration of primary and foreign keys in the PostgreSQL database.
# Exploratory analysis
For the exploratory analysis, univariate analyzes were performed on all
tables in addition to multivariate analyzes with the comparison of variables such as count
of votes, positions and parties.
# Creation of Textual File
Aiming to present the findings obtained, this file was developed with
aid of the LaTeX language, with details of the execution of each stage of the
scientific process and the results obtained.
